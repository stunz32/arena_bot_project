**Problem Identified**: `UnicodeEncodeError` crashes when running in Windows PowerShell environment due to cp1252 codepage limitations with UTF-8 emoji characters.

**Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)**:
- **Why #1**: Logger crashed with UnicodeEncodeError? ‚Üí UTF-8 characters written to cp1252 stream
- **Why #2**: Stream expecting cp1252? ‚Üí Windows PowerShell default codepage  
- **Why #3**: Logger not configured for this? ‚Üí No explicit encoding set on handlers

- **Why #5**: Not designed for cross-platform? ‚Üí Assumed UTF-8 environment

**Solution Implemented**:
- [x] **P-H1.1**: Created `logging_config.py` with platform-aware logging system
