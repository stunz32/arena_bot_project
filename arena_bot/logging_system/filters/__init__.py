This module contains filters that process and route log messages based on
various criteria including level, rate limiting, correlation tracking,
and security considerations.

Filters:
- LevelFilter: Smart level-based routing
- RateLimiter: Prevent log flooding with token bucket algorithm
- CorrelationFilter: Correlation ID management and tracking
- SensitiveDataFilter: PII and credential scrubbing for security
