# Arena Bot - Resume Session Guide

## 🎯 Current Status (July 11, 2025)
**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Real screenshot testing is fully working!

### ✅ What's Working
- **Card Detection**: Successfully identifying cards from actual Hearthstone screenshots
- **Template Matching**: Mana cost and rarity detection working (fixed thresholds)
- **Histogram Matching**: Card identification using Arena Tracker's algorithms
- **Dependencies**: All Python packages installed and working in WSL
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive headless testing that bypasses Qt/GUI issues

### 🧪 Latest Test Results
From real Hearthstone screenshot (3440x1440):
- **Card 1**: AV_326 (1 mana, rare) - confidence: 47.2%
- **Card 2**: BAR_081 (7 mana, legendary) - confidence: 30.4%  
- **Card 3**: AT_073 (7 mana, rare) - confidence: 38.8%

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK
**Implement automatic Hearthstone window detection**

Currently the bot requires manual region positioning. For production use, it needs to:
1. **Auto-detect Hearthstone window** anywhere on screen
2. **Locate arena UI elements** using template matching
3. **Calculate card positions** dynamically relative to UI

## 📁 Key Files to Resume With
- `test_screenshot_headless.py` - Working screenshot testing
- `arena_bot/detection/template_matcher.py` - Fixed template matching
- `arena_bot/detection/histogram_matcher.py` - Fixed histogram computation
- `todo.md` - Complete progress tracking

## 🔧 Environment Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/marcco/arena_bot_project

# Dependencies already installed, but if needed:
PYTHONPATH="/home/marcco/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

# Test that everything still works:
python3 test_screenshot_headless.py screenshot.png
```

## 📋 Session Commands to Resume
1. `claude --resume` (to restart Claude Code)
2. Navigate to `/home/marcco/arena_bot_project`
3. Check `todo.md` for current status
4. Begin implementing automatic window detection

## 🔍 Technical Details
- **Database**: 500 cards loaded for testing (can expand to 4000+)
- **Resolution**: Tested with 3440x1440 ultrawide
- **Template thresholds**: Mana 10.0, Rarity 20.0 (adjusted for better detection)
- **WSL compatibility**: Using headless testing to avoid Qt GUI issues

## 🎮 Next Implementation Focus
Window detection will likely involve:
- Process enumeration to find Hearthstone
- Window screenshot capture
- UI template matching for arena interface
- Dynamic region calculation based on found UI elements

The core detection pipeline is solid - now need to make it work automatically!
