# Methods for Card Recognition and Game Tracking in Digital Card Games

## Vision-Based Recognition Approaches

-   **Template Matching & Perceptual Hashing:** Many projects identify cards by matching their images against a database of known card images. For example, a Hearthstone Twitch bot uses **perceptual hashing (pHash)** – it precomputes hashes of all card and hero images, then computes the hash of regions in the screen and finds matches by Hamming distance[github.com](https://github.com/wittenbe/Hearthstone-Image-Recognition#:~:text=Important%20for%20both%20recognition%20tasks,detection%20of%20a%20game%27s%20start). This method was sufficient to detect which cards are in hand or on board, and even identify the player’s hero, enabling automated deck tracking. In ambiguous cases, additional image features can be used – the same Hearthstone bot falls back on SURF feature matching to distinguish look-alikes (e.g. differentiating the coin for first vs second player, or the similar “Victory”/“Defeat” banners)[github.com](https://github.com/wittenbe/Hearthstone-Image-Recognition#:~:text=What%27s%20missing%20is%20the%20detection,both%20coins%20and%20both%20texts). A similar approach has been used for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) – one open-source MTG card detector segments card images and then computes a perceptual hash to identify the card by comparing to a pre-hashed library of card images[tmikonen.github.io](https://tmikonen.github.io/quantitatively/2020-01-01-magic-card-detector/#:~:text=The%20recognition%20of%20the%20card,hashing%20the%20reference%20set%20significantly). Template matching works well when cards are fully visible and a database of images is available, though it can be sensitive to image scaling or partial occlusion.
    
-   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Card Text:** Another strategy is to read the card’s name (or other text) from the screen and look it up. This is effective even if only part of the card is shown, as long as the title text is visible. For instance, **mtgscan** for Magic: The Gathering chooses to apply OCR to the card title in a photo or screenshot and then uses a dictionary of card names for matching[fortierq.github.io](https://fortierq.github.io/mtgscan-ocr-azure-flask-celery-socketio/#:~:text=Mtgscan%20is%20a%20project%20aiming,Optical%20Character%20Recognition)[fortierq.github.io](https://fortierq.github.io/mtgscan-ocr-azure-flask-celery-socketio/#:~:text=Image%20Example%20of%20stacked%20cards,card%20is%20only%20partially%20visible). In that project, Tesseract (an open-source OCR) was tried but performed poorly on MTG card fonts, so the developer switched to a cloud-based OCR (Azure OCR) which gave much better results[fortierq.github.io](https://fortierq.github.io/mtgscan-ocr-azure-flask-celery-socketio/#:~:text=Text%20recognition%20). The recognized text is then fuzzy-matched against the known card list (e.g. using approximate string matching to correct minor OCR errors)[fortierq.github.io](https://fortierq.github.io/mtgscan-ocr-azure-flask-celery-socketio/#:~:text=,in%20sideboard%20is%20totally%20wrong). This OCR approach handles cases where cards overlap or are partially visible (common when scanning a stacked collection or a hand of cards) since you only need a bit of the name to identify the card. Similar OCR-based card recognizers exist for other games – for example, **YuGiOCR** is a Yu-Gi-Oh! card detector that uses Tesseract OCR on the card name and set symbols to identify the card[github.com](https://github.com/Jaster111/YuGiOCR#:~:text=Jaster111%2FYuGiOCR%3A%20Simple%20YuGiOh%20card%20detector,lightning%20scenarios%20and%20positioning%20scenarios). OCR methods rely on clear text and might struggle if the in-game text is stylized or small, but they can be very flexible across large card sets.
