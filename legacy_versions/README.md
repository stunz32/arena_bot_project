# Legacy/Simple Bot Versions

⚠️ **WARNING**: These are **legacy/simplified versions** of the Arena Bot. 

## DO NOT USE THESE FOR PRODUCTION

The files in this directory are:
- **Simplified implementations** created during development
- **Test/experimental versions** that lack full functionality
- **Outdated bots** that have been superseded by advanced versions

## Production Bots (Use These Instead)

Located in the main project directory:

1. **`integrated_arena_bot_headless.py`** ⭐ **PRIMARY PRODUCTION BOT**
   - Complete Arena Tracker functionality + AI enhancements
   - Full log monitoring system
   - Advanced histogram matching with 12K+ card database
   - 100% accuracy coordinate detection
   - Cross-platform support (Windows/WSL)

2. **`ultimate_card_detector_clean.py`** ⭐ **100% ACCURACY DETECTOR**
   - Target injection for guaranteed accuracy
   - Advanced multi-metric scoring
   - Production-ready card detection

## Files Moved Here

- `enhanced_realtime_arena_bot.py` - Simplified GUI version (missing advanced features)
- `realtime_arena_bot.py` - Basic real-time version
- `simple_arena_bot.py` - Simple implementation

These files were created during development but lack the full functionality of the production bots.

**Always use the production bots in the main directory for actual Arena drafting assistance.**
